# My Admin Platform

A platform software application, to provide an administration interface in order
to provide an individual with means, to help self-actualise one self.

## Form

The platform should come into the form of an admin panel / page in a web browser
or on a mobile device presented through a native app or also a web browser.
The admin panel is the view on ones development level, but should also act as a
portal to further development. What areas of life, of oneself can someone focus
on, and what tools tools does the platform offer for this.

## Why self-actualisation

## Education will set you free

One major pillar of self-actualisation aid is education. By educating a person,
you help the individual on the journey of self-actualisation. By offering
learning tools,
sources of information, and the tools for others to explain subjects, but also
to create exercises for training tools, an environment is created in which
anyone
can more easily reach the point of self-actualisation.
